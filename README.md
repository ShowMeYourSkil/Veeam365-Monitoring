# Features

## Monitoring of backup jobs

If there is a problem with your backup (backup could not be completed successfully or the job ended with a warning) you will be informed about it.

## Monitoring of the licenses

The check monitors whether and how long your Veeam 365 license is valid. 
If your license is overused or the lifetime is about to end or has already ended, you will receive an alert.
